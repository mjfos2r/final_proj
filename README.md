This is my final bioinformatics project, much of it was done on an Apple Silicon M1, a Ryzen running windows, and eventually in the clunky praxis VM. Windows is once again proving how impossibly painful it is to do anything with code. Originally I attempted to do the course through vim at the very start but quickly retreated back into R-Studio. VSCode on Windows10 is the only redeeming quality and was used for text editing. The workflow for this was highly convoluted and could have been simplified by just sticking with one machine. I have no idea why, but apparently Berkeley's CRAN mirror went down right around the time I was getting into intensive debugging. (maybe it was always down?) anyways. R is fun, windows10 is not.
